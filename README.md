## Motivation for the project
When I was trying to drop food to FeedMore's donation bins, I noticed that it's hard to find and visualize all the locations. So I thought well I should build an APP that helps people easily find donation location and facilitate food donation process. Then I made it. Hope this helps :) - Lei');
